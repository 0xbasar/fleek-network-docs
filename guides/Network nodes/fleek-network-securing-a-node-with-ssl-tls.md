## Introduction

Secure Sockets Layer or Transport Layer Security are the technologies used to keep an internet connection secure by protecting sensitive data that is transferred between systems. It's a protocol for servers and web clients to ensure that data passed between them is private!

A secure connection is required to prevent others from modifying, reading or tampering with the data that is transmitted. Otherwise, it can be intercepted by third parties, such as hackers.
HTTP connections are insecure by default. SSL, or TLS (the modern version of SSL), uses advanced encryption algorithms in transit, keeping the data transferred over the connection private.

You've likely noticed `HTTPS://` when surfing the web, and more specifically when making payments or dealing with sensitive data! This is used to secure and encrypt the connection.

Nonetheless, accessing a service via `HTTPS://` does not make it secure, as the SSL/TLS requires a valid certificate that is processed by a [Certificate Authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority). Historically, SSL/TLS Certificates are usually purchased from a retailer that acts as a Certificate Authority (CA), known to be costly and especially when setting up multiple web services!

In recent years, the non-profit organization [Let's Encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Encrypt) started providing TLS certificate encryption, that is free of charge. The Let's Encrypt organization also improved the administration experience by providing automation features for system administrator processes.

In that respect, we'll look into how to secure a Fleek Node with TLS certificates provided by Let's Encrypt, by harnessing the knowledge provided in our [Running a node in a Docker container](fleek-network-running-a-node-in-a-docker-container) guide. We'll look into how to set up our custom domain in the Nginx configuration, generate dummy certificates, and finally real certificates to understand how the certificate automation is handled to mitigate issues, such as expiration.

The knowledge demonstrated here should be useful and can be easily applied to native setups (none Docker). As some troubleshooting and differences are found in different systems, we'll stick with our Docker Stack for that matter and simplicity!

If you have any feedback or questions join [our community Discord](https://discord.gg/fleekxyz) channel!

## Pre-requisites

To follow the guide, you will need the following:

- Familiarity with the command-line interface
- Ability to run the Docker Stack successfully as instructed in our [Running a node in a Docker container](fleek-network-running-a-node-in-a-docker-container) or [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAFIDu3UBvw)
- Have a domain name and DNS setup management permissions (ideally if you want to persist a domain for a long time, we'll provide you with a free alternative that is dynamic and only suitable for the demo)

## What are SSL/TLS certificates?

An SSL Certificate is a file that is stored on a web server that represents the content of an encrypted key. A certificate file only contains information that is relevant to authenticate a service. Some of the properties of the file include a key pair (a public and private key that work together to establish an encrypted connection), the issuer of the certificate, and the associated subdomains.

In practice when a user navigates to a secure service, the user gets a public key, establishes an encrypted connection and has the server identity verified.

Nowadays, most web clients use TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption, which is used as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Although should be noted that SSL certificates are predecessors of TLS (TLS is an improvement that evolved from SSL), however, the names TLS and SSL remain interchangeable as certificates!

## Why secure the Network Node?

Provide a form to authenticate the Network Node server, and without it, the end client that consumes the data is at higher risk of having transmitted data stolen. You want the ability to authenticate your Network Node!

The secure HTTPS protocol is a norm, while HTTP is obsolete! A Fleek Network Node that is not secure may be punished for bad behavior and thus not be rewarded.

Since this is a serious web security vulnerability, [attackers can place themselves between](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) the users' client and your Network Node server, and intercept sensitive data in transit.

> You want to secure the server for better participation in the network and ensure good behavior, rewards, and global network security.

## Domain name setup

A domain name is required to follow the instructions, these can be registered by a domain registry provider such as [Open domain registry](https://www.opendomainregistry.net/), [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en-GB) and many others! Some domain name registrys' provide SSL certificates as an additional service, but we are going to create TLS certificates on our own, so you won't need the domain name registry provider SSL service for this guide!

💡 SSL without a domain is possible, but we are going to work with domain names to keep this guide simple. If you are looking into securing a public IP Address, you'll have to do it on your own or wait for a future guide!

The domain name DNS records should point to the Network Node server IP address so that when the custom domain is requested, the DNS translates into the server IP address. Our reverse proxy (NGINX) will identify itself with the transport-layer authentication mechanism that includes the SSL certificates.

### How to set up the DNS settings for a Node server?

Create or update the `A record` to point to the server IP Address.

As an example, let's say that we have a domain `fleek.xyz`, where we set up a subdomain `fleek-network-node` and that our server IP Address (where the Fleek Network Node is running from) is `181.196.118.156`.

The custom domain address would be:

```sh
fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz
```

💡 Keep a note about the domain name as it'll be required for your reverse proxy configuration (NGINX).

Our server IP Address (this should be public, accessible outside the private network, otherwise external Nodes won't be able to communicate):

```sh
181.196.118.156
```

Depending on the "domain name registry" dashboard, you'd have to update the `A Records`, here's an example:

| Type        | Host                              | Answer            | TTL         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| A           | fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz      |  181.196.118.156  | 300         |


Learn more about record types [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types).

DNS changes may take some time to propagate, thus make sure to [verify the DNS records](#how-to-verify-dns-records).

### Alternatively, getting a free domain name for testing?

Domain names are costly, you might not have one, or not be interested at this time! For this reason, we're going to provide some hints on how to set up a free domain name for your server.

There are plenty of free domain server providers, but for this guide, we will opt for [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com). There are other alternatives such as [Localhost.run](localhost.run) or [LocalTunnel.me](https://localtunnel.me), but we're keeping things simple here and will not try to provide support for anything else. Using an alternative should be quite similar!

> While `localhost`.run` doesn't require you to install any apps, it requires exposing port 22 publicly and some users might not be happy about it.

Bear in mind that the domain address provided by this service changes whenever you restart it! Purchasing a domain is better in the long term (which services like Ngrok also provide), as otherwise, you'd have to modify the configuration every time you restart the server as the domain changes, etc. 

With that in mind, let's use `Ngrok`, as a quick demo only!

Visit the [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com), visit the downloads page and follow the instructions to install it on your operating system. Here's how we'd install it for Linux `snap` package manager users.

```sh
snap install ngrok
```

Or, via Apt

```sh
curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null && echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list && sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok
```

Once installed, you can do a quick check by checking the version:

```sh
ngrok --version
```

You should get a response

```sh
ngrok version 3.1.0
```

To create a new domain name via `Ngrok`, use the following syntax:

```sh
ngrok http 80
```

The Ngrok process will generate the following output, where you can find the address created (that is publicly accessible) which maps to the server port `80`. Our reverse proxy forwards request to port `80` to our `Ursa` node. Find more about how the services work in the [Node Health check guide](fleek-network-node-health-check-guide).

```sh
Add Okta or Azure to protect your ngrok dashboard with SSO: https://ngrok.com/dashSSO

```

We can conclude that at the time of running, `Ngrok` generated the following domain:

```sh
https://94e7-159-65-87-194.eu.ngrok.io 
```

> Be aware that this is useful for a quick demo, by stopping the Ngrok process the domain it generates might differ if you are not a paying customer. We have no affiliation with `Ngrok` and you are happy to use whichever domain provider of your liking. We are only using `Ngrok` as a quick example for the users educational interest. If you've been following the guide, should know that the domain name is declared in the reverse proxy configuration file and the Let's encrypt initialisation script, meaning you'd have to update it everytime. In fact, Ngrok forces HTTPS by default, you wouldn't have to set up, but in any case we are not knowledgable with the service it provides and the level of security but its useful for quick demos.

### How to verify DNS records?

Once you have [set up the DNS records](#how-to-set-up-the-dns-settings-for-a-node-server), verify the records are set correctly, for that you can easily run `dig` CLI or website like [mxtoolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/). As an example, we're going to use the `dig` CLI!

`Dig` (Domain Information Groper) is a network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS). Read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)).

```sh
dig fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
```

```sh
;fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz.      IN	A
fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz.		484 IN	A	181.196.118.156
```

👆 The goal is to determine if the DNS record matches the machine IP Address we set up earlier. There might be cases you'll need to wait longer, but it's good to double-check your DNS record dashboard and revise it if the desired settings fail to show!

There are many other tools you can use to verify the DNS records, feel free to pick your favorite!

## Stack Services

In our [Running a node in a Docker container](fleek-network-running-a-node-in-a-docker-container) guide, we propose a Stack to run the Network Node that offers you a service for:

- Ursa - The Network Node (Ursa CLI process)
- Nginx - A reverse proxy for Ursa Node service
- Prometheus - A monitoring system for real-time metrics with a web client
- Grafana - Metric visualization for logs, traces, etc.

This can be fully customized or exchanged for other options for the reverse proxy, monitoring or metric visualization. You are free to pick your tools!

⚠️ We only provide support for [Ursa CLI](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa), which we are developing. You'll have to visit the official project for more information on how to operate them!

## NGINX SSL/TLS configuration

Our Nginx reverse proxy has `app.conf` file where the SSL certificate(s) are, or can be configured. We keep the `app.conf` pre-configured with an example that you can modify with yours.

If we recall our [Running a node in a Docker container](fleek-network-running-a-node-in-a-docker-container) and [Video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAFIDu3UBvw), the SSL configuration is omitted to keep things simple, as the configuration requires a domain name, etc. 

⚠️ If you try to run the Node Stack with the example SSL setup, it'd fail. There aren't any valid SSL/TLS certificates, you need valid SSL/TLS certificates to operate HTTPS and secure your reverse server connections! We'll look into this briefly in the section [Which came first: the chicken or the egg?](#which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg)

We removed the SSL on those guides to keep things simple for you, but it's not recommended for production! You are incentivized to operate the Node to the best knowledge and follow security principles for greater rewards and helping to have a healthy and secure network!

Considering where we left off on the guide, we are going to provide instructions to make it easier for you to get started securing the Node!

### Which came first: the chicken or the egg?

We'd like to start our Stack, but Nginx reverse proxy fails to perform the "Let's Encrypt" validation. This causes the reverse proxy to not start because the certificates are not valid. Leading to the "Which came first: the chicken or the egg?" problem!

We need Nginx to perform the Let’s Encrypt validation somehow! The process that is commonly found if you search online is the following:

- Create a dummy certificate
- Start Nginx
- Delete the dummy certificate
- Request the real certificates

By happy chance, you don’t have to do all this tedious process manually, as its a known issue you'll find scripts (like the [one](https://github.com/wmnnd/nginx-certbot/blob/master/init-letsencrypt.sh) we borrowed from) shared by the community that can be very convenient to automate the process for you.

### Creating a valid certificate

We are going to run the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script that we have borrowed from [Philipp
wmnnd Github account](https://github.com/wmnnd/nginx-certbot/blob/master/init-letsencrypt.sh).

You don't have to fork it, as we have a [fork/copy](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/blob/main/docker/full-node/init-letsencrypt.sh) available to you in your local repository. Find it in the path `docker/full-node/init-letsencrypt.sh`.

### Preparing the Let's Encrypt initialization script

Make sure that you have execution writes to execute the script. To set the correct permissions, you can run the following command from the root of your local `ursa` repository:

```sh
chmod +x docker/full-node/init-letsencrypt.sh
```

Modify the Nginx `app.conf` file with the correct custom domain name and also the path where the SSL/TSL certificate for the custom domain is going to be stored once the `Let's Encrypt` initialization runs.

1) Replace the Nginx `server_name` property that has `ursa.earth` declared to yours.

```sh
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name node.ursa.earth www.node.ursa.earth;

    ...
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name node.ursa.earth www.node.ursa.earth;

    ...
}
```

As we are using `fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz`, as an example that'd look like:

```sh
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz;

    ...
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz;

    ...
}
```

😅 Notice that we have omitted a lot of text for your convenience, you can always check out our remote repository for the original files, for example [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fleek-network/ursa/cd6fb3d21ce647dc3f06ee9128ba2a4164623ee5/docker/full-node/data/nginx/app.conf). 

If you have followed our introductory guides, you have probably commented out or removed the SSL configuration, keep reading to find the template or check the repository `app.conf` as mentioned earlier.

⚠️ Beware, that this is highly customizable and we might make tweaks in any earlier version of `ursa` which that guide might not consider. Check our original repository for any updates! Also, some advanced users have a preference to modify this on their own. In any case, for more on this you have to check the [Nginx docs](https://docs.nginx.com/) to learn more!

2) Replace the pathname with your custom domain, by replacing the following `ursa.earth` domain with yours

```sh
# SSL code
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/ursa.earth/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ursa.earth/privkey.pem;
```

For our demo, we replace `ursa.earth` to `fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz`

```sh
# SSL code
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz/privkey.pem;
```

3) If you have followed our guides, it's likely that you have commented out or removed the lines for the SSL certificates in the Nginx `app.conf` file.

Here's an example of the missing part and how it should look like (take particular care that you have to replace `<YOUR DOMAIN NAME>` and that this is only if you have deleted the SSL configuration part in the `app.conf` file):

```sh
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name <YOUR DOMAIN NAME>;

    server_tokens off;

    # SSL code
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR DOMAIN NAME>/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR DOMAIN NAME>/privkey.pem;

    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    location /stub_status {
      stub_status;
    }

    location / {
      add_header content-type  application/vnd.ipld.raw;
      add_header content-type  application/vnd.ipld.car;
      add_header content-type  application/octet-stream;
      add_header cache-control public,max-age=31536000,immutable;

      proxy_cache nodecache;
      proxy_cache_valid 200 31536000s;
      add_header X-Proxy-Cache $upstream_cache_status;
      proxy_cache_methods GET HEAD POST;
      proxy_cache_key "$request_uri|$request_body";
      client_max_body_size 1G;


      proxy_pass http://ursa:4069;
    }
}
```

### Running the Let's Encrypt automation script

First, change the directory to the `docker/full-node` path in your local repository. This is where our `init-letsencrypt.sh` is located!

```sh
cd docker/full-node
```

The directory file structure should look like:

```sh
.
├── README.md
├── data
├── docker-compose.yml
└── init-letsencrypt.sh
```

We have to provide a domain name, such as the example `fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz` and a valid email address `ops@fleek.xyz` that you as an operator have access to.

```sh
EMAIL="<VALID EMAIL>" DOMAINS="<DOMAIN WITH CORRECT DNS RECORDS>" ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

Since we have already:

- Updated the `A Records` in the [previous step](#how-to-set-up-the-dns-settings-for-a-node-server)
- [Verified](#how-to-verify-dns-records) that the DNS records are correct

We can execute the `init-letsencrypt.sh` by prefixing the script with the variables `EMAIL` and `DOMAINS`.

- DOMAINS - A list separated by space, e.g. `DOMAINS="foobar.com my-node.fleek.xyz"`
- EMAIL - A valid email address that the server administrator, the ops operator or anyone of concern should have access to, e.g. `ops@fleek.xyz`

```sh
EMAIL="<VALID EMAIL>" DOMAINS="<DOMAIN WITH CORRECT DNS RECORDS>" ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

For our example, that would look a bit like this:

```sh
EMAIL="ops@fleek.xyz" DOMAINS="fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz" ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

If the script is executed successfully, the output should be similar to (have in mind that we are using `fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz` as an example, you should see yours):

Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2023-04-25.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate will need to be renewed before it expires. Certbot can automatically renew the certificate in the background, but you may need to take steps to enable that functionality. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup for instructions.

### Reloading nginx ...
2023/01/25 18:56:34 [notice] 17#17: signal process started
```

It's a long output but we can find the last few paragraphs useful, where it reads:

```sh
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2023-04-25.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
```

You may also find that the paragraph after, that mentions that the certificate expires is important. If you are running the Docker Stack we provide, the `certbot` is installed and automating the certification for you.

### How to run a domain name health check?

As previously instructed in our [guide](fleek-network-node-health-check-guide), we can do a quick health check by making `cURL` requests to our server and reading the response. There's the option to get the response body that should be text `pong` or get some HTTP Headers.

```sh
curl https://<YOUR DOMAIN NAME>/ping
```

For our example, we have the domain `fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz` and this is how the `cURL` request would look like:

```sh
curl https://fleek-network-node.fleek.xyz/ping
```

A successful response should be `pong`

```sh
pong
```

Use the flag `-I` to get the HTTP Headers. To learn more read the guide [here](fleek-network-node-health-check-guide).

You can do these tests from any remote location that is not your server or local machine and the health check should pass, as the port should be publicly available to any service on the internet.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! If you reached this far you have improved the security of your Network Node and helped contribute to a safer Fleek Network!

By providing a brief introduction to SSL/TLS certificates, the reasons why they exist or why you'd want to secure the Network Node, we jumped quickly to the domain name setup. After completing the verification of the DNS records, where our Stack and Node are running from, prepared the SSL configuration in our Nginx `app.conf` to then have the certificates generated by `Let's encrypt`.

To complete we verified that our Node is healthy by doing a quick checkup, using one of the options previously discussed in our [Node health check](fleek-network-node-health-check-guide) guide. We have then secured the Node!

While we do our best to provide the clearest instructions, there's always space for improvement, therefore feel free to make any contributions by messaging us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fleekxyz) or by opening a [PR](https://github.com/fleek-network) in any of our repositories 🙏.

During testnet phase, you have to checkout to the testnet tag. For example, the first testnet tag name was [fn-alpha-0](https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning/releases/tag/fn-alpha-0) that you would have to be checked in order to run a node successfully. A list of the active tags can be found at anytime in the GitHub repository [active tags](https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning/tags). While we try our best to update documentation, guides, instructions or any other written content during development, there might be breaking changes that might take some time to reflect in our documents. To avoid disappointment, check into the correct branch or contribute by getting in touch with us, or sending a PR in the relevant context, thank you!

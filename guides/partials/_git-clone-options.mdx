You have several ways of doing this:
- Clone via HTTPS
- Clone via SSH
- Download via Github CLI
- Download the [zip package](https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning/archive/refs/tags/fn-alpha-0.zip) from the repository

We recommend HTTPS because it is the easiest to set up in the wild, and by users who are new to all this.
Although, we strongly recommend using an SSH connection when interacting with GitHub. If you are to this and are interested read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning.git --branch fn-alpha-0 --single-branch <DIRECTORY-NAME>
```

At time of writing, we are checking the branch name `testnet-alpha-0` that corresponds to the testnet phase.
Here's an example of what it'd look like when sticking to the recommended path location:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning.git --branch fn-alpha-0 --single-branch ~/fleek-network/lightning
```

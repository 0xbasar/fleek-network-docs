You have several ways of doing this:
- Clone via HTTPS
- Clone via SSH
- Download via Github CLI
- Download the [zip package](https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from the repository

We recommend HTTPS because it is the easiest to set up in the wild, and by users who are new to all this.

```sh
git clone -b testnet-alpha-0 https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning.git
```

Although, we strongly recommend using an SSH connection when interacting with GitHub. If you are to this and are interested read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

```sh
git clone -b testnet-alpha-0 git@github.com:fleek-network/lightning.git
```

ðŸ’¡ Optionally, you can pass a directory name at the end of the commands (as the last argument), otherwise defaults to the repository name and for our case the name is `lightning`. Note that you don't have to use `<` or `>` when naming, it's just illustrative.

```sh
git clone -b testnet-alpha-0 https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning.git <DIRECTORY-NAME>
```

Here's an example of what it'd look like when sticking to the recommended path location:

```sh
git clone -b testnet-alpha-0 https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning.git ~/fleek-network/lightning
```

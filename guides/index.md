The guides provide step-by-step instructions and descriptions to help understand how and why you'd have to do or execute certain commands or processes.

It differs from the [references](/references) documentation which serves as a quick direct breakdown of commands and processes without much explanation, as the name implies.

To start, find guides by consulting the available categories to locate the content on the sidebar. Our guides are also available as a result when using the search feature located at the very top of the documentation site.

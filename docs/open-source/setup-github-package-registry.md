## üëª Configure NPM for Github Package Registry

You'll need to have @Psychedelic Github Package Registry setup, if you haven't done for other projects find out how here.

To pull and install from [@Psychedelic](https://github.com/psychedelic) via the NPM CLI, you'll need:

- A personal access token (you can create a personal acess token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
- The personal access token with the correct scopes, **repositories**, **org repositories** and **read:packages** to be granted access to the [GitHub Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

Once you have those ready, run:

```sh
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@Psychedelic
```

> **Note:** You only need to configure this once to install the package!

    On npm login provide your Github email as your username and the Personal access token as the password.

You can also setup your npm global settings to fetch from the Github registry everytime it finds a **@Psychdelic** package:

```sh
npm set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken "$PAT"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Alternatively, a token could be passed to the `.npmrc` as `//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=xxxxxx` but we'd like to keep it clean, tokenless. Here's an example where the `PAT` is an environment variable:

```sh
@psychedelic:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${PAT}
```

Whichever option is best for you, you'll then be able to install packages from `@psychedelic`, such as the `@psychedelic/plug-connect`.

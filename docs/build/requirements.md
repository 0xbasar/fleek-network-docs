This section provides the requirements for the server specifications on which the Fleek Network Node can be installed and run.

:::caution warning
Only 64-bits distributions are supported. Do not try to install it on a 32-bits operating system!
:::

# Server
---

The Fleek Network node binary is only supported by a Linux server. Currently, we are only providing support for the following distros:
- Debian
- Ubuntu

:::tip
Support for other OS will be made available soon, e.g. CentOS and Fedora. Any contributions to provide support for your favorite distro are welcomed! Feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/fleek-network) in our repositories.
:::

Because of the use of Linux containerization technology, other operating systems, such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, Windows and others are not supported.

If you donâ€™t have a server or a spare machine, keep reading as we'll give you some hints on how to rent one, although we are not affiliated with any provider.

# Specs
---

The Fleek Network node binary is only supported on CPUs that adhere to the x86_64 architecture (64-bit).

A minimum of 32 GB of memory is required and a reasonable amount of disk space for the installation and running processes, which at the minimum should be around 20 GB.

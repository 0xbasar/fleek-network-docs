The Node process requires the following ports:

- RPC (port 4069)
- Narwhal
    - Primary (port 8000)
    - Worker (port 8001)
    - Mempool (port 8002)

Thereâ€™s a single worker at the protocol level. In the future, if a node is allowed to run >1 worker, the ports can look like (worker#X):

- Narwhal
    - Worker (port 80X1)
    - Mempool (or 80X2)


:::caution required
The ports should be freed before launching the node process. Any blockers or firewalls should be configured to enable the ports.

Many Web3 products rely on the conventional models of centralized cloud infrastructure, due to the lack of corresponding alternatives.

Some of the most popular Web3 products rely on content delivery and edge computing provided by the monopolized cloud market. Unlike a decentralized system, the central opposite is more vulnerable to attacks, as data and computation can be easily manipulated to suit the monopoly's business goals.

Meanwhile, blockchain technology has paved the way for a new era of decentralized cloud computing and data storage, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional centralized architectures.

The Fleek Network provides the alternative, paving the way to a decentralized edge computing future that is secure, transparent and accessible to everybody.

## A decentralized internet

The original vision for the Internet was to build a network where everyone could participate, access and share information. But this was compromised after individuals and organizations found ways to trap and monetize information gathered from users.

Thankfully, the emerging movement to break free from centralization, and privacy concerns, resembles the original vision of the Internet. A decentralized Web, which's often referred to as Web3, where building services are free of central authorities.

A Decentralized Web envisions a world where services are powered by the community.

## Open protocol

On decentralization, we achieve resilience, a service shouldn't die when one company goes out of business. Plus, the process of incremental improvement of a protocol, and transparency of open-source development, can have it refined into something impossible to displace. As achieved by the protocols: POP3/SMTP, TCP/IP, DNS, Bitcoin, etc.

The underlying assumption is that you can't ever be finished with anything. However, as more time passes the more refined the product becomes and the less you need to change it.

An essential part of a decentralized web is that companies, organizations and individuals choose to run applications using open protocols and data formats.

## The next generation of Internet services

Cloud computing has become essential for modern life, thanks to advancements in internet technology that make our lives easier.

The demand for content delivery and computation is skyrocketing, and due to the rise of AR/VR, video, gaming, and other media content popularity, demand will keep going up.

Our society is turning obsessively digital, and most of our daily activities are digitally recorded. Technology is meddling with personal data and thoughts, culture and relationship with each other.

Cloud Providers have a central infrastructure giving immense control to obscure authorities that can influence computations, block access to data, and even manipulate it.

On the other hand, Cloud Providers depend on costly infrastructure that requires a significant number of resources. Traditionally, these are dispersed geographically but more commonly located in convenient regions for the businesses; that is, a resolver might only find a resourceful node close to you sometimes.

In contrast, it'd be extremely difficult to compete as a provider due to the corporative establishment that dominates the internet. Fairer economic incentives have a growing interest from computer resource providers and related communities.

Most Web3 services have their client-facing interfaces hosted and delivered through centralized Cloud Providers, breaking the trust upfront and causing considerable disappointment to the end user.

Since Decentralized Storage, Edge Computing and Peer-to-peer Networking technology are a reality, a decentralized content delivery network or Serverless functions, amongst others, are possible â€” helping achieve the goal of a fully decentralized Web experience.

The next generation of Internet Services brings tremendous cost benefits, high availability, geographic distribution and betterment of the performance, load times and perceived user experience.

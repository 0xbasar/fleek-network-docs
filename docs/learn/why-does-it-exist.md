The demand for content delivery and computation is skyrocketing, and due to the rise of AI, video, gaming, and other media content popularity, demand will keep going up. 

Cloud Providers have a central infrastructure giving immense control to obscure authorities that can influence computations, block access to data, and even manipulate it.

On the other hand, Cloud Providers depend on costly infrastructure that requires a significant number of resources. Traditionally these are dispersed geographically but more commonly located in convenient regions for the businesses; that is, a resolver might only find a resourceful node close to you sometimes.

In contrast, it'd be extremely difficult to compete as a provider due to the corporative establishment that dominates the internet. Fairer economic incentives have a growing interest from computer resource providers and related communities.

Most Web3 services have their client-facing interfaces hosted and delivered through centralized Cloud Providers, breaking the trust upfront and causing considerable disappointment to the end user.

Since Decentralized Storage, Edge Computing and Peer-to-peer Networking technology are a reality, a decentralized content delivery network or Serverless functions, amongst others, are possible â€” helping achieve the goal of a fully decentralized Web experience.

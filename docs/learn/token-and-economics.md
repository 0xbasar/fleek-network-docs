The Fleek Network runs on an incentivized economy model that rewards node operators who provide resources that form the network, where end users pay for usage.

## The genesis block

The token and economy model starts with a fixed inflation rate, which after the adoption phase transitions to a dynamic minting mechanism based on network utility.

## The Utility Token

Fleek Network has a utility token named FLK, an ERC-20 token issued on Ethereum (L1). The Fleek Network interacts with it as native to the protocol. The token intent is user accessibility and familiarity, making the interactions in the system as frictionless as possible. This is achieved via a Proof-of-Consensus bridge that facilitates entry and exit from Fleek Network—a Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) bridge that enables token retrieval.

## A Proof-of-Stake layer

A secure ledger of transactions is maintained for validation, request fulfillment and consensus. At every epoch (about 24 hours), a committee is formed from a subset of any valid staked node.

## Economic Model Sustainability Measures

Node Operators are incentivized to lock the FLK token staked to boost the rewards through inflation. As otherwise, the inflationary economic model would pose a sustainability challenge—as node operation exodus would occur based on inflation rate drops. With the opt-in lock feature, committing to the network long-term, results in boosted rewards given the token's longevity.

Node Operators have the option to participate and lock their staked amount for a maximum of four years, maximizing their potential rewards.

## The Reward distribution

To encourage long-term participation, the Fleek Network has implemented several reward mechanisms that impact the way nodes are awarded and distributed.

As described in the [economic model sustainability measures](#economic-model-sustainability-measures), a node operator who chooses to opt-in and lock the tokens staked for a given period boosts the emission of token rewards. The time-lock period plays a role in the total distribution of awards across the network, as the minted token distribution mechanism to entitled nodes is based on it.

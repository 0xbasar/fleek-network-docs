The Fleek Network runs on an incentivized economy model that rewards node operators who provide resources that form the network, where end users pay for usage.

## The genesis block

The token and economy model starts with a fixed inflation rate, which after the adoption phase transitions to a dynamic minting mechanism based on network utility.

## The Utility Token

Fleek Network has a utility token named FLK, an ERC-20 token issued on Ethereum (L1). The Fleek Network interacts with it as native to the protocol. The token intent is user accessibility and familiarity, making the interactions in the system as frictionless as possible. This is achieved via a Proof-of-Consensus bridge that facilitates entry and exit from Fleek Network—a Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) bridge that enables token retrieval.

## A Proof-of-Stake layer

A secure ledger of transactions is maintained for validation, request fulfillment and consensus. At every epoch (about 24 hours), a committee is formed from a subset of any valid staked node.

## Economic Model Sustainability Measures

Node Operators are incentivized to lock the FLK token staked to boost the rewards to counter inflation. As otherwise, the inflationary economic model would pose a sustainability challenge—as node operation exodus would occur based on inflation rate drops. With the opt-in lock feature, committing to the network long-term, results in boosted rewards given the token's longevity.

Node Operators have the option to participate and lock their staked amount for a maximum of four years, maximizing potential rewards.

Time-locking is a way to increase revenue for Node Operators without causing inflation to rise beyond the targeted inflation rate. 
By keeping the token staked at a stable level, operators ensure that the total token staked across the network remains consistent and doesn't fluctuate wildly.

So Node Operators looking to boost revenue should consider time-locking as a viable option to contribute positively to the overall health of the network.

## The Reward distribution

To encourage long-term participation, several reward mechanisms were implemented that impact the way nodes are awarded and distributed.

As described in the [economic model sustainability measures](#economic-model-sustainability-measures), a node operator who chooses to opt-in and lock the tokens staked for a given period boosts the emission of token rewards. The time-lock period plays a role in the total distribution of awards across the network, as the minted token distribution mechanism to entitled nodes is based on.

The total emitted FLK token rewards per epoch are distributed to the stakeholders in the network, such as:

- Fleek Foundation—although it has no percentage of the token inflation at the network launch (due to sufficient tokens in the initial allocation), the protocol distribution percentages can change through governance when deemed necessary.
- Node Operators—critical to the network, is a system actor incentivized to manage one or many nodes, ultimately making form the Fleek Network by sharing resources in exchange for rewards.
- Service builders—due to their valuable contribution to the development of innovative services, are entitled to a portion of emission rewards as royalties and incentives for continuous innovation.

The distribution of these rewards among the stakeholders is detailed in the following table:

| Stakeholder       |    Percentage (%)    |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Fleek Foundation  |           0%         |
| Node Operator     |          80%         |
| Service builder   |          20%         |

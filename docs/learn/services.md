## Overview 

A Fleek Network Service is a modular application that runs on nodes and allows users to perform well-defined functions or some specific tasks. Services are scalable and performant due to edge computation and networking features provided by the core principles of the network.

As a permissionless system, services are built by developers who're free to build and deploy them to run on the decentralized edge platform. Applications can be of any kind but are generally described as web services. These are cryptographically secure and run within a fair economically incentivized model. The services are hosted in user-managed resources and are highly available to customers and end-users in exchange for rewards.

A Service Development Toolkit (SDK) facilitates access to core APIs and resources for developers. Services run in a sandboxed environment (unable to access the host's processes, hardware and kernel directly) and are restricted to specific features such as cryptography, networking and storage. The service implementation source code is fully managed by the author(s), owner(s) and development team(s).

At an early stage, core services are statically linked to the node's binary process (Lightning). In the future, the Fleek Network protocol aims to load services dynamically.

## Service Development Toolkit (SDK)

The Service Development Toolkit (SDK) abstracts the core protocol features, including the communication with the middleware which is done through an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system. Any system-level programming language, such as C/C++, Go or Rust can establish a communication channel with the middleware. By using the toolkit, a Service builder accelerates the development process e.g. effectively enables nodes to generate Delivery Acknowledgements (SNARKs) that prove work completion which is used to determine rewards, along with other cryptographic commitments.

:::info
As discussed in [The Network](/docs/learn/network) section, [Delivery Acknowledgements](/docs/learn/network#delivery-acknowledgements-snarks) include metadata about the commodities consumed by a node while executing or running a service. It also contains cryptographically secured metadata that are tamper-proof and used to determine the reward attributed to a node.

A commitment ensures clients receive the correct work output that is being requested, such as content, a computed response, etc. In addition to preventing malicious services from coercing a node into making false commitments. Likewise, the commitments generated by a node determine the bandwidth and computation served, amongst other commodities.

## Handshake

The Handshake component is the entry point to external communications with a node. It enables clients to establish an encrypted communication session with the node and interact with services over a secure transport layer (TLS+TCP or QUIC). On establishing a client and node connection, public keys are exchanged and a lane is negotiated for the session. A Handshake is required for a client to access and interact with a service.

## Overview 

A Fleek Network Service is a modular application that runs on nodes and allows users to perform well-defined functions or some specific tasks. Services are scalable and performant due to edge computation and networking features provided by the core principles of the network.

As a permissionless system, services are built by developers who're free to build and deploy them to run on the decentralized edge platform. Applications can be of any kind but are generally described as web services. These are cryptographically secure and run within a fair economically incentivized model. The services are hosted in user-managed resources and are highly available to customers and end-users in exchange for rewards.

A Service Development Toolkit (SDK) facilitates access to core APIs and resources for developers. Services run in a sandboxed environment (unable to access the host's processes, hardware and kernel directly) and are restricted to specific features such as cryptography, networking and storage. The service implementation source code is fully managed by the author(s), owner(s) and development team(s).

At an early stage, core services are statically linked to the node's binary process (Lightning). In the future, the Fleek Network protocol aims to load services dynamically.

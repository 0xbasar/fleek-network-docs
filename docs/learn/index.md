## Introduction

The Core of Fleek Network offers a foundational layer to enable developers to build and deploy Edge Services efficiently. It abstracts away the development complexities of consensus, cryptography, storage and peer-to-peer networking, etc, to simplify things conceptually. It frees developers and teams to focus on what matters the most to reach business goals.

In contrast, end users have access to network services on the edge, that provide different kinds of computation and data processing features.

We'll take a brief look into [why it exists](/docs/learn/why-it-exists), [how it works](/docs/learn/how-it-works), and learn about [services](/docs/learn/network/services), amongst other topics.

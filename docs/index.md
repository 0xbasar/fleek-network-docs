## About Fleek Network

Fleek Network is an open-source Edge Computing Platform to accelerate the development and execution of decentralized Web Services.

The system builds on a distributed network of Nodes, where services run within a fair and incentivized ecosystem constituted by an open community of developers and operators who hold and control their private identities.

You can run a Node or build a Service without permission. In contrast, consume any Fleek Network computational resources provided by services on demand.

The Fleek Network's documentation is organized as follows:

[Documentation](docs) brief breakdown of the Fleek Network.

[Engineering](blog) offers a deeper look into how our engineering team works, research, and technology behind Fleek Network.

The [Guides](guides) provide step-by-step instructions for performing specific tasks.

[Reference](reference) section provides short materials for Fleek Network command-line interfaces (CLIs), and application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing the resources and development. It is assumed that you already have a basic understanding of important concepts.

[Develop](develop) learning materials for development and contributions.

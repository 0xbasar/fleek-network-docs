Fleek Network is an open-source Edge Computing Platform to accelerate the development and execution of decentralized Web Services.

The system builds on a distributed network of Nodes, where services run within a fair and incentivized ecosystem constituted by an open community of developers and operators. Who can freely operate Nodes or build services without the need for approval or permission. Or simply, consume Fleek Network resources on demand provided by the services running on the Edge.

Applications, platforms and protocols build and utilize decentralized services on Fleek Network to optimize performance and reduce dependency on centralized cloud providers. Developers can build faster and launch better products by offloading parts of the stack to the Edge to focus on core features.

:::tip
To participate in the [Alpha Testnet](/docs/roadmap), you can begin by setting up and running nodes.
Proceed to the [build](/docs/build/overview) section for an overview of the server [requirements](/docs/build/requirements) and instructions to [install](/docs/build/install) a Fleek Network node.

:::info
The Fleek Network's documentation is organized as follows:

[Documentation](docs) brief breakdown of the Fleek Network.

[Engineering](blog) offers a deeper look into how our engineering team works, research, and technology behind Fleek Network.

[Guides](guides) provide step-by-step instructions for performing specific tasks.

[References](references) section provides short materials for Fleek Network command-line interfaces (CLIs), and application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing the resources and development. It is assumed that you already have a basic understanding of important concepts.

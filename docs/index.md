Fleek Network is an open-source Edge Computing Platform to advance the development and execution of decentralized Web Services.

Fleek Network is a platform for Apps, Protocols and Service builders looking to achieve decentralization without sacrificing cost and user experience â€” a robust solution for a broad range of use cases, including Content Delivery and Serverless functions.

The system builds on a distributed network of Nodes, where services run within a fair and incentivized ecosystem constituted by an open community of developers and operators who hold and control their private identities.

You can run a Node or build a Service without permission, start the journey by reading the [documentation](#documentation).

## About the documentation

The documentation serves as a knowledge base, a place to discover, learn and build in the Fleek Network, to get up and running through Guides, References and other learning materials.

It cultivates a system contributor of all kinds of knowledge levels who are willing to develop skills and learn enough to troubleshoot on their own, including reporting issues, contributing to the community and helping other operators.

Clients, developers and operators can discover a wide range of learning content and support.

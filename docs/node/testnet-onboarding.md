## Testnet Phase {1}:

Following the successful completion of Fleek Network Testnet Phase {0}, the core development team has been actively implementing the next set of core protocol functionalities, which include services, the rewards system, the broadcaster/synchronizer, as well as all identified improvements and fixes found during that phase.


The Testnet Phase {1} is open to everybody. To join, you will have to follow the steps below:

1) Install the Fleek Network Lightning CLI latest version. Find the instructions to installer [here](/docs/node/install), if you already have it installed use the update instructions [here](/references/Lightning%20CLI/update-cli-from-source-code)

Once Fleek launches the Testnet Phase {1}, you have to install or update the Lightning CLI binary to the latest version. The instructions are available [here](/docs/node/install) where you can use an assisted installer or install it manually by following the documentation. If you already have it installed, use the update instructions provided [here](/references/Lightning%20CLI/update-cli-from-source-code).

:::caution Warning
The Testnet Phase {1} version should only be available after the Testnet Phase {1} is ready and announced. Since we work transparently (open-source) some users rush to install things on their own and misaligned which causes issues. The Fleek Network core team is required to provide all the changes, features and tests before announcing publicy that the testnet phase is ready. Otherwise, you'll be running the process prematurely, be patient please!
:::

2) Setup the Metamask browser extention

Open the Metamask `settings`, located in the drop-down (top-right menu options).

- Network Name: `Fleek Network Testnet`
- RPC URL: `https://rpc.testnet.fleek.network/rpc/v0`
- Chain ID: `1337`
- Currency symbol: `FLK`

3) Visit the faucet website

Before proceeding, make sure to have the Fleek Network selected as the metamask network. Once confirmed, visit the [Faucet website](https://TODO:add-faucet-url)

4) Connect wallet

In the [Faucet website](https://TODO:add-faucet-url), you have to `Connect Wallet`.

5) Mint FLK

Once `Connect Wallet` is ready, proceed to `Mint FLK` and wait until the balance of the account in your Metamask increases. You need to have `FLK` before proceeding. Be patient.

6) Stake FLK

Once `FLK` balance is available, click in the `Stake` button. You'll be required to provided the following details from your node:

- Node Public Key
- Consensus Public Key
- Server IP Address

You can get the details by running the **node details** script in your terminal connected to your machine or server, as follows:

```sh
curl https://get.fleek.network/node_details | bash
```

The response should be similar to the following:

```
ðŸ¤– Your server details are the following

The Node Public Key is XXXXXXXX
The Consensus Public Key is YYYYYYYY
The Node Server IP address is Z.Z.Z.Z
```

:::caution warning
Make sure that you copy and paste the correct values otherwise the transaction it'll fail.
:::

7) Confirm the transaction on metamask

It is important to note that when transacting through Metamask, a warning message might pop up regarding gas costs, but rest assured that there won't be any deductions from your wallet balance.

You'll have to wait for Metamask to confirm the transaction, which Metamask should take about 10 seconds to confirm. Although, the transaction takes under a second.

Important to note that in Testnet Phase {1} the Epoch is set to about 30 minutes. This is the average period you'll have to wait to see any meaningful logs.

8) Start the Node

Visit the section [Systemd Service](/docs/node/systemd-service) to learn how to enable, disable, start, stop the Systemd Service.

:::note
The Systemd Service is setup automatically by the assisted installer, manually if you have followed the instructions provided, or the docker install. If you have a custom set up, you'll have to do the equivalent to start the node as described in the section [Systemd Service](/docs/node/systemd-service).
:::

Make sure you do a quick healthcheck:

```
curl -w "\p" localhost:4230/health
```

To learn more about healchecks read the section [here](/docs/node/health-check).

9) Confirm Node Stake

To confirm the Node Staked amount, you can run the **node details** script to get the information. The **node details** output will only show staked information if available, if it doesn't show staked information it means that your Node is not properly staked.

Check the Node stake by running the following command in the machine or server where the node is setup:

```sh
curl https://get.fleek.network/node_details | bash
```

Alternatively, the Stake amount can be verified by querying the [RPC-JSON API](/docs/learn/the-network/#json-rpc-interface) method `flk_get_node_info`. 

## Troubleshooting

The Fleek Network core team might have to restart the network, for any development purposes or required updates during the Testnet Phase {1}. If you've done this process before and is running into issues, you'll have to go into the Metamask advance settings (Metamask â†’ Settings â†’ Advanced) and click `Clear Local data`. After doing this Metamask will clear the cache.

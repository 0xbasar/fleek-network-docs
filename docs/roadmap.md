## Current state: Road to Testnet

Our current roadmap on the road to an early teestnet stands as follows:

### August

- Testnet Launch (initial phase of a multi-phased path to Mainnet)
- Initial Edge Services (CDN and compute PoC services)
- Service Development Kit (initial release)

The initial phase of testnet will have two main purposes. First, to stress test the networkâ€™s general performance and operation with a decentralized network of node operators with varying hardware; Second is to test the first two POC services, which are the CDN (static and dynamic content acceleration) and a simple edge compute POC.

The second phase of the testnet which will happen in the first half of September (depending on when exactly the first testnet phase starts), will be to introduce the Service Development Kit (SDK) and test out people building new services on the test network.

## Mainnet

The mainnet release of Fleek Network will come with the arrival of a stable and end-to-end tested version of the protocol. Details on the transition to mainnet will be discussed later in the future.

We will continue to update this roadmap in the short and long term to reflect the different stages the network goes through.

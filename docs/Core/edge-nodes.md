This documentation is currently placeholder as the team prepares for an early testnet release around the month of August. Full documentation for node runners and services will arrive in due time, near the aforementioned testnet release. Current open source code is highly experimental and may be subject to change.

## Welcome node operators, what is the current status of Fleek Network? âš¡

Currently we are working towards our next milestone: the **first early testnet in August 2023**.

As a node operator, you will be able to run edge nodes for this testnet and contribute resources like bandwidth, CPU, and GPU to power services as we test the network's capabilities.

## How can you start getting involved?

1. Get familiar with the project [with our Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.fleek.network).
2. Review our open-source [codebase on Github](https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning/).
3. Want to run a node? Join our community [in Discord to get updates when possible](https://discord.gg/fleekxyz).
4. Or sign up to the newsletter on [our website](https://fleek.network/) for updates.

**The node code on our Github is still experimental, but you are welcome to review and provide feedback at this stage**
